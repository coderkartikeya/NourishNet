# 🥗 NourishNet: Hyperlocal Food Rescue Platform

**NourishNet** is a real-time microservices-based platform designed to bridge the gap between surplus food (restaurants, events) and those in need (NGOs, shelters). By utilizing a hybrid architecture, it ensures both the **security** of data and the **instantaneous** communication required to prevent food spoilage.

## 🚀 The Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:** Food waste often happens because the coordination between donors and volunteers is too slow. Traditional request-response systems (refreshing a page) lead to delays where food expires before it can be claimed.

**The NourishNet Solution:**

* **Real-time Dispatch:** Volunteers within a 5km radius receive instant "Flash Alerts" via WebSockets.
* **Trust & Compliance:** Every donation is logged, verified, and audited to ensure food safety standards and provide tax benefits to donors.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project follows a **Hybrid Microservices Architecture** to leverage the unique strengths of different technologies:

### **Frontend**

* **React.js:** Single Page Application (SPA) for a smooth, app-like user experience.
* **Leaflet.js/Google Maps:** For real-time geospatial visualization of active donations.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For a responsive, modern mobile-first design.

### **Backends**

* **Spring Boot (The "Trust" Layer):** * Handles User Authentication (JWT), NGO Verification, and Transactional Integrity.
* Manages the persistent data layer (History, Profiles, Certificates).


* **Node.js & Socket.io (The "Speed" Layer):** * Manages real-time bidirectional communication.
* Broadcasts donation alerts to nearby volunteers with sub-100ms latency.



### **Database**

* **PostgreSQL + PostGIS:** Used for high-performance geospatial queries (finding volunteers within a specific coordinate radius).

## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Hyperlocal Geo-fencing:** Only volunteers near the donation site are alerted, reducing notification fatigue.
* **Real-time Leaderboard:** Gamifies volunteering by showing the impact (kgs of food saved) in the community.
* **Automated Tax Receipts:** Donors receive PDF certificates generated by Spring Boot upon successful delivery.
* **Zero-Collision Claiming:** Node.js ensures that once a volunteer claims a donation, it is instantly "locked" for others.

## 📈 Why Hybrid Architecture?

In an interview, I can justify this tech stack as follows:

* **Why Spring Boot?** For its robust ecosystem, strong typing, and excellent handling of complex business logic and security.
* **Why Node.js?** To handle the asynchronous nature of WebSockets efficiently without blocking threads.
* **Why PostgreSQL/PostGIS?** To handle the mathematical complexity of spherical geometry required for accurate location tracking.
